# Methodology

## Phase 1: Requirements Gathering and Planning

This methodology outlines the steps for developing and deploying an AskHR agent leveraging IBM watsonx Orchestrate and watsonx.ai, as depicted in the provided architecture diagram. This agent will empower employees to interact with HR systems and access information efficiently through conversational AI.

- Identify Use Cases:
Conduct workshops with HR stakeholders and employees to identify common HR inquiries and tasks suitable for automation.
Prioritize use cases based on impact, frequency, and feasibility.
Examples: Time off balance, time off requests, personal information updates, policy inquiries, etc.

- Define Scope and Objectives:
Clearly define the scope of the AskHR agent, including supported functionalities and integrations.
Establish measurable objectives, such as reduced HR ticket volume, improved employee satisfaction, and faster response times.

- Technical Feasibility Assessment:
Evaluate the existing HR systems and data sources for compatibility with IBM watsonx Orchestrate.
Assess the availability of APIs and data access mechanisms.
Determine the need for custom integrations or data transformations.

- Security and Compliance Considerations:
Identify relevant security and compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
Define data access controls and authentication mechanisms.
Implement data encryption and anonymization techniques as needed.

## Phase 2: Development and Configuration

- Environment Setup:
Provision IBM watsonx Orchestrate and IBM watsonx AI instances.
Configure CodeEngine for deploying custom code and integrations.
Set up necessary integrations with HR systems and data sources.

- Skill Studio Development:
Utilize Skill Studio in watsonx Orchestrate to create individual skills for each identified use case.
Define the skill's trigger phrases, input parameters, and output responses.
Leverage OpenAPI specifications to integrate with HR systems and retrieve/update data.
Develop custom code in CodeEngine for complex logic or data transformations.

- AI Agent Configuration:
Configure the HR Agent in watsonx Orchestrate to orchestrate the execution of individual skills.
Define the agent's conversation flow and decision-making logic.
Implement natural language understanding (NLU) models to accurately interpret employee requests.

- Agent Lab Development:
Utilize Agent Lab in watsonx AI to develop and train the conversational AI model.
Define intents and entities based on the identified use cases.
Train the model with sample conversations to improve accuracy and fluency.

- Web Search and Crawler Tool Integration:
Integrate the Web Search and Crawler tool in Agent Lab to enable access to external information sources, such as company websites or knowledge bases.
Configure the tool to extract relevant information and present it to the employee in a conversational format.


## Phase 3: Testing and Validation


- Unit Testing:
Test individual skills and integrations to ensure they function correctly.
Verify data accuracy and consistency.

- Integration Testing:
Test the interaction between the HR Agent and other components, such as Skill Studio, Agent Lab, and HR systems.
Validate the end-to-end flow of each use case.

- User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
Conduct UAT with a representative group of employees to gather feedback on the agent's usability and effectiveness.
Identify and address any issues or bugs.

- Performance Testing:
Evaluate the agent's performance under different load conditions.
Identify and address any performance bottlenecks.


## Phase 4: Deployment and Monitoring


- Deployment:
Deploy the AskHR agent to a production environment.
Ensure proper security and access controls are in place.

- Monitoring and Maintenance:
Continuously monitor the agent's performance and usage.
Track key metrics, such as conversation success rate, response time, and user satisfaction.
Analyze user feedback and identify areas for improvement.
Regularly update the agent with new skills and functionalities.

- Continuous Improvement:
Implement a feedback loop to continuously gather employee feedback and identify new use cases.
Regularly update the AI model and skills to improve accuracy and fluency.
Stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in conversational AI and incorporate them into the AskHR agent.

- Key Considerations:
1. User Experience: Design the agent with a focus on providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.
2. Personalization: Personalize the agent's responses based on the employee's role, location, and other relevant factors.
3. Scalability: Design the architecture to be scalable to accommodate future growth and increasing demand.
4. Security: Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive employee data.
5. Accessibility: Ensure the agent is accessible to all employees, including those with disabilities.

By following this methodology, organizations can successfully implement an AskHR agent with IBM watsonx Orchestrate, empowering employees with self-service HR capabilities and improving overall HR efficiency. This approach fosters a more engaging and productive employee experience, allowing HR teams to focus on strategic initiatives.
