## Use Case Description

This use case targets developing and deploying an AskHR agent leveraging IBM watsonx Orchestrate, as depicted in the provided architecture diagram. This agent will empower employees to interact with HR systems and access information efficiently through conversational AI. 

In this lab we will build an HR agent in watsonx Orchestrate, leveraging tools and external knowledge to connect to a simulated Human Capital Management System. This agent retrieves relevant information from documents to answer user queries and  allows users to view and manage their profiles.

   When the user requests time off, convert the dates to YYYY-MM-DD format, e.g. 5/22/2025 should be converted to 2025-05-22 before passing the date to the post_request_time_off tool.
   ```
