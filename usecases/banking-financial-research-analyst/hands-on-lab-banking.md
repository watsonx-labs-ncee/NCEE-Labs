<img width="900" alt="image" src="images/banking-fra-architecture.png">

## Pre-requisites
To run the steps in this hands-on lab portion of the bootcamp, you need access to **watsonx Orchestrate** and **watsonx.ai** which are provided for you as part of the preparation for this bootcamp.

- Please go the through the [environment-setup](https://github.ibm.com/skol/agentic-ai-client-bootcamp/tree/staging/environment-setup) guide for steps on API key creation, and project setup.

- Check with your instructor to make sure **all systems** are up and running before you continue.


## watsonx Orchestrate
As detailed in the [Solution Architecture](images/banking-fra-architecture.png), we will build and deploy the majority of the agents for the solution in watsonx Orchestrate. AI Agents are autonomous entities that can run tasks, decide and interact with their environment. In IBM watsonx Orchestrate, agents are a key component enabling the creation of complex, dynamic systems that can adapt and respond to changing conditions. 

### Accessing watsonx Orchestrate
To access watsonx Orchestrate, follow these steps:

1- If not already logged into your IBM Cloud account, navigate your preferred browser to https://cloud.ibm.com and log in with your credentials (which you used for your TechZone reservation).

2- On your IBM Cloud landing page, click the top left navigation menu (hamburger menu) and select **Resource list** (annotated with red rectangle).
*Note: If you are a member of multiple IBM Cloud accounts, make sure you are working in the correct account (annotated with red oval) which has the required services available as explained in the [environment-setup](https://github.ibm.com/skol/agentic-ai-client-bootcamp/tree/staging/environment-setup) guide.*
![IBM Cloud Resource List](images/ibm_cloud_resources.png) 

3- On the Resource List page, expand the **AI / Machine Learning** section (annotated with red arrow), and click the **Watsonx Orchestrate** service (annotated with red rectangle) service name.
![IBM Cloud wxo](images/ibm_cloud_wxo.png) 

4- Click **Launch watsonx Orchestrate** (annotated with red arrow) to launch the service.
![wxo launch](images/wxo-launch.png) 

5- Once watsonx Orchestrate service is launched, you would be at its landing page as illustrated in the figure below. You will see an intuitive conversational interface with a chat field (annotated with red rectangle) where you can type any text to start interacting with watsonx Orchestrate. When you start with a new service instance, there will be no custom agents defined and thus, the section under **Agents** will state *No agents available*. You can either click **Create or Deploy** an agent under the Agents section or you can click **Create new agent** (annotated with red arrow) to start developing new agents. You can also select the **Manage agents** link to navigate to the agent management page.
Try to type a few generic questions and observe the responses from the large language model (LLM) powering the prebuilt agent in watsonx Orchestrate which ensures basic functionality until custom agents are created.
![wxo landing page](images/wxo-landing-page.png) 

## Financial Analyst Agent Creation
In this section, you will go through the process of creating an AI agent in watsonx Orchestrate:

6- To start building agents, you can click the **Create new agent** link as referenced in step 5 or alternatively, click the top left navigation menu, expand the **Build** section (annotated with red arrow) and select **Agent Builder** (annotated with red rectangle). This will redirect you to the Manage agents page.
![wxo agent builder](images/wxo-nav-menu-agent-builder.png) 

7- The Manage agents page will initially be blank since no agents have been created yet. As you create more and more AI agents that can reason and act, the Manage agents page will be populated with those agents. Note the analytics captured at the top of the page including **Total messages**, **Failed messages**, and **Latency average** (annonated with red rectangle). Also, note the **Discover** button (annonated with red oval) which you can click to explore and discover the [catalog of pre-built agents and tools in watsonx Orchestrate](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/watson-orchestrate/base?topic=discovering-catalog). Click **Create agent** button (annotated with red arrow) to start building your first agent.
![wxo create agent](images/wxo-create-agent-manage-agents-empty.png) 

8- On the Create an agent page, select **Create from scratch** tile (annotated with red rectangle), provide a **Name** and a **Description** for the agent and click **Create** (annotated with red arrow).

Name: 
```
Financial Analyst Agent
```

Description: 
```
Agent skilled at financial research using internal knowledge and external search of public information.
```
The natural language description of an agent is important as it is leveraged by the agentic solution to route user messages to the right agent skilled in addressing the request. For more details, please review the [Understanding the description attribute for AI Agent](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/watson-orchestrate/current?topic=agents-creating#understanding-the-description-attribute-for-ai-agent) documentation.

watsonx Orchestrate supports creating an agent from scratch or from a template which involves browsing a catalog of existing agents and using attributes of another agent as a template for the new agent. For this lab, you will be creating agents from scratch.

*Note: It is recommended to review the [What are AI Agents?](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents) blog for some background on how AI agents work.*
![wxo financial analyst agent](images/wxo-financial-analyst-agent.png) 

### Agent Configuration with Knowledge Base
After the AI Agent is created, in this section, you will go through the process of configuring the agent with knowledge and tools to enable it to respond to queries using information from the knowledge base and perform tasks using the tools.

9- Next, you will go through the process of configuring your agent. The Financial Analyst Agent page is split in two halves. The right half is a **Preview** (annotated with red oval) chat interface that allows you to test the behavior of your agent. The left half of the page consits of five key sections (annotated with red rectangle) that you can use to configure your agent.

   - Profile: The **Profile** section consists of the description of the agent which you provided as part of creating the agent. You can always go to this section to edit and refine the description of the agent as needed. In this section, you also specify the **Agent style** whether *Default* or *ReAct*. 
   
   *Note: For more details, Please consult the [Choosing a reasoning style for your agent](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/watson-orchestrate/base?topic=agents-choosing-reasoning-style-your-agent) documentation to understand the difference and how it affects the agent's behavior.*

   - Knowledge: The **Knowledge** section is where you can add knowledge to the agent. Adding knowledge to agents plays a crucial role in enhancing their conversational capabilities by providing them with the necessary information to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses for specific use cases. You can directly upload files to the agent, or connect to a Milvus or Elasticsearch instance as a content repository. Through this **Knowledge** interface, you can enable your AI agents to implement the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern which is a very popular AI pattern for grounding responses to a trusted source of data such as enterprise knowledge base.
   
   *Note: For more details, please consult the [Adding knowledge to agents](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/watson-orchestrate/current?topic=agents-adding-knowledge) documentation.*

   - Toolset: While *Knowledge* is how you empower agents with a trusted knowledge base, then **Toolset** is how you enable agents to take action by providing them with *Tools* and *Agents*. Agents can accomplish tasks by using **Tools** or can delegate tasks to other **Agents** which are deeply skilled in such tasks.

   *Note: For more details, please consult the [Adding tools to an agent](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/watson-orchestrate/current?topic=agents-adding-tools) and [Adding agents for orchestration](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/watson-orchestrate/current?topic=agents-adding-orchestration) sections of the documentation.*
   
   - Behavior: The **Behavior** section of the agent configuration is where you provide instructions to the agent to define how it responds to user requests and situations. You can configure rules that dictate when and how the agent should take action. These rules help the agent behave in a predictable and consistent manner, delivering a seamless user experience.

   *Note: For more details, please consult the [Adding instructions to agents](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/watson-orchestrate/current?topic=agents-adding-instructions) documentation.

   - Channels: The **Channels** section is how you expose your agent to different communication platforms (for example, Slack). This integration improves user experience and agent accessibility. At ths time of this lab writing, channel support is in *Preview* with support for *WebChat*, *Microsoft Teams*, and *WhatsApp with Twilio*. The product will be adding support for additional channels where you can deploy your agent(s).

   *Note: For more details, please consult the [Connecting to channels](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/watson-orchestrate/base?topic=agents-connecting-channels) documentation.

Lastly, after you've completed your agent configuration and tested its performance, you can **Deploy** the agent (annotated with red arrow) to make it available through the selected channel. 

![wxo create agent config](images/wxo-create-agent-config.png) 

10- On the agent configuration page, review the *Description* of the agent in the **Profile** section and keep as is (no edits necessary). Also, keep the *Agent style* selection as **Default**. Next, scroll down to the **Knowledge** section, or click the **Knowledge** shortcut (annotated with red oval). In the Knowledge section, add a description to inform the agent about the content of the knowledge. For this lab, add the following description as we will provide the agent with a number of recent earnings reports for a handful of companies.

Description: 
```
This knowledge addresses all details about earning reports for the companies of interest. Research analysts can ask about any details from earning reports.
```

Next, you have to choose how to provide knowledge information to the agent. watsonx Orchestrate supports adding knowledge to the agent either by uploading files directly through the UI or by pointing to a content repository (Mivlus or ElasticSearch). The [Adding knowledge to agents](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/watson-orchestrate/current?topic=agents-adding-knowledge) documentation provides more details. For this lab, click the **Upload files** button (annotated with red arrow) to upload pdf files capturing earnings reports for AMZN, META, NVDA, and NFLX.

![wxo agent config knowledge](images/wxo-agent-config-knowledge.png) 


Drag and drop the following pdf files to upload to the knowledge for the agent :
   - [AMZN-Q4-2024-Earnings.pdf](documents/AMZN-Q4-2024-Earnings.pdf)
   - [META-Q4-2024-Earnings.pdf](documents/META-Q4-2024-Earnings.pdf)
   - [NFLX-Q4-2024-Earnings.pdf](documents/NFLX-Q4-2024-Earnings.pdf)
   - [NVDA-Q4-2024-Earnings.pdf](documents/NVDA-Q4-2024-Earnings.pdf)

![wxo knowledge upload files](images/wxo-knowledge-upload-files.png) 


11- Once the files are all uploaded to the knowledge base, you can start testing the agent to validate how it can respond to questions using this knowledge base. The uploaded files get processed and prepared to be leveraged by the agent. After the upload completes, test the agent by asking a few questions such as:

```
Can you tell me about Meta's business
```

You should see the responses being retrieved from the uploaded documents and then the final response generated by the agent as illustrated in the figure below. Click *Show Reasoning* (annotated with red oval) and also *Step 1* to review the agent's reasoning and validate it is correctly retrieving the answer from the knowledge base. Additionally, click the *Toggle Citation* icon (annotated with red arrow) to show the actual document from which the response is retrieved. Note it is correctly getting the response the Meta's earnings report (annotated with red rectangle).

![wxo agent knowledge test meta](images/wxo-agent-knowledge-test-meta.png) 

Try another test as follows:

```
I'm interested in learning more about Meta and Amazon. Can you tell me a bit about their businesses?
```
Observe the response being generated using the knowledge base. As before, click the *Toggle Citation* icon (annotated with red arrow) to show the refernced documents. Click *Next* icon (annonated with red oval) to review all retrieved documents.

![wxo agent knowledge test meta amazon](images/wxo-agent-knowledge-test-meta-amazon.png) 

Feel free to try a test like ```Give Toyota q4 financial results``` and review the response from the agent which should indicate that it has no information about Toyota as shown in the figure below.

![wxo financial agent knowledge negative](images/wxo-financial-analyst-knowledge-negative-test.png) 

At this time, it is worthwhile taking a moment to reflect on what you've developed so far. You have designed an agent and empowered it with a knowledge base to enable it to respond to queries in context using its knowledge base. *Congratulations!!*

Reviewing the architecture, you've completed the part of the agentic solution which involved creating the Financial Analyst agent and empowering it with a knowledge base (annotated with red rectangles in the figure below). In the next section, you will work through the process of creating the **Financial API Agent** and the **Web Search Agent** which you will then add as collaborator agents to the **Financial Analyst Agent**.

![wxo agent knowledge complete](images/wxo-financial-research-agent-knowledge-complete.png) 

## Financial API Agent Creation and Configuration
In this section, you will develop the Financial API Agent, one of the collaborator agents which is specifically skilled at returning market data and glossary definitions. In this hands-on lab, the Financial API Agent is empowered with two tools, the **Market Data Tool** which returns stock prices and the **Glossary Tool** which leverages Wikipedia to return glossary definitions. In practice, this agent can also get access to other internal tools such as those for modeling stock behavior or forecasting stock prices; the approach to empower the agent with such tools would be the same.

12- If you are not at the watsonx Orchestrate landing page (chat interface), repeat the steps above to make sure you are logged into IBM Cloud, find the watsonx Orchestrate service and launch it to access the landing page.

13- From the watsonx Orchestrate langding page, click **Create agent** (annotated with red rectangle) to start developing a new agent, the Financial API Agent.

![wxo create agent chatUI](images/wxo-create-agent.png) 

14- On the Create an agent page, select **Create from scratch** tile , provide a **Name** and a **Description** for the agent and click **Create** (annotated with red arrow).

Name: 
```
Financial API Agent
```

Description: 
```
Agent skilled in retrieving market data as well as glossary definitions for financial terms.
```
As explained earlier, the decription of an agent is important as it is leveraged by the agentic solution to route user messages to the right agent skilled in addressing the request.

![wxo create financial api agent](images/wxo-create-financial-api-agent.png) 

15- On the agent configuration page, scroll down to **Toolset** section or click the shortcut (annotated with red oval). Then cick the **Add tool** button (annotated with red arrow) to bring up the window for adding tools to the agent.

![wxo agent tools](images/wxo-agent-tools.png) 

16- On the tool options pop-up, select **Import** (annotated with red rectangle) as illustrated in the figure below. 

![wxo tool options](images/wxo-tool-options.png) 

watsonx Orchestrate supports multiple approaches to adding tools to agents as explained in the [Adding tools to an agent](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/watson-orchestrate/current?topic=agents-adding-tools) documentation:

   - Add from catalog: The **Add from catalog** option enables you to add a tool from a rich catalog of pre-defined tools. The catalog of tools is actively being developed to make it even easier to add tools to agents.

   - Add from local instance: The **Add from local instance** option enables you to add a tool from an existing set of tools already uploaded to the local instance of watsonx Orchestrate. 

   - Import: The **Import** option enables you to import an external tool using an OpenAPI specification and selecting which operations you want to import as tools.

   - Create a new flow: The **Create a new flow** option provides you with a drag and drop tool builder interface to create a sequence of steps that utilize conditional controls and activities. 

Additionally, you can use the watsonx Orchestrate [Agentic Development Kit (ADK)](https://developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/) to develop and upload Python and OpenAPI tools to a specific watsonx Orchestrate instance which you can then add to the agents.
watsonx Orchestrate also supports the addition of [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/) tools. If you are not familiar with it, MCP is a standard for connecting AI Agents to systems where data lives including content repositories, business tools and development environments. MCP is becoming increasingly popular as the standard for enabling agents with tools.

For purposes of the Financial API Agent, you will use the **Import** option to import an OpenAPI specification and define which operations to import as tools. You will need a **financial_api_openapi.json** file which will be provided by your instructor. 

On the *Add a new tool* pop-up, select **Import from file** tile (annonated with red rectangle).

![wxo tool import from file openapi](images/wxo-tool-import-from-file-openapi.png) 

17- On the Import tool page, drag and drop the **financial_api_openapi.json** file provided by your instructor (annotated with red rectangle) and click **Next** (annotated with red arrow).

![wxo tool import openapi](images/wxo-tool-import-openapi.png) 

18- Next, select the checkboxes for the **Get Stock Price Data**, **Get Stock Information**, **Get Financial Statements**, **Get Earnings Report**, and **Search Wikipedia** operations (annotated with red arrows) and click **Done**.

![wxo tool import operations](images/wxo-tool-import-operations.png) 

19- At this point, you will see the tools imported under the Tools subsection which means they are available for the **Financial API Agent** to use these tools in executing tasks that require retrieving market data or getting glossary information. 

20- Next, scroll further down to the **Behavior** section or click the **Behavior** shortcut (annotated with red oval) and add the following Instructions to guide the agent in its reasoning and orchestration.

```

Also, switch the slide bar to the off position (annotated with red arrow) to disable making the **Financial API Agent** accessible on the chat interface. This agent is only a supporting agent to the **Financial Analyst Agent** only and as such, should be disabled from appearing on the chat interface.

![wxo financial agent behavior](images/wxo-financial-api-agent-behavior.png)

21- Now that you have completed the creation of the agent and added the tools it requires, test the tools in the **Preview** section by asking a sample question such as:

```
what was Amazon's revenue and profit in 2023?
```

Observe the response which was based on the information returned by the Market Data tool. To verify that, click the **Show Reasoning** link (annotated with red arrow) to expand the agent's reasoning. Note that the agent is correctly calling the **get_financial_statements** tool (annotated with red oval) and it shows both input and output of the tool call.

![wxo tool earnings](images/wxo-financial-api-agent-tool-earnings.png) 

22- Test the **Financial API Agent** further by asking another question:
```
What does EBITDA mean?
```

Again, observe the response and expand the **Show Reasoning** link to trace through the agent's reasoning which in this case correctly triggered the **search_wikipedia** tool (annotated with red oval).

40- Scroll further down to the **Behavior** section or click the **Behavior** shortcut (annotated with red oval) and add the following **Instructions** to guide the agent in its reasoning and orchestration.

Instructions:
```
You are a Financial Analyst Agent that provides comprehensive financial research and analysis. Your capabilities include:

**Stock Analysis:**
- Get real-time stock price data and historical performance using finance APIs
- Retrieve comprehensive company information including financial metrics, market data, and business descriptions
- Access detailed financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement) with both annual and quarterly data

**Research & Information:**
- Search the web for current financial news, analyst reports, and market insights using Web Search
- Find definitions of financial terms and company background information using Wikipedia search
- Knowledge base consisting of recent earnings reports

You have a knowledge base consisting of recent earnings reports for Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Netflix. You also have support from two agents, Financial API agent and Web Search agent. 
Use the Financial API agent to retrieve financial metrics like P/E ratio, market cap and stock price. Use Financial API agent also for financial term definitions.
Use the Web Search agent to retrieve recent news and current information about the company such as current executive leaders.
```

Test the agent behavior in the **Preview** section by asking the following sample question:
Question: 
```
I'm interested in learning more about Meta and Amazon. Based on their earnings reports, can you please generate a summary about their business priorities and strategy?
```

Expand the **Show Reasoning** and **Step 1** links to review the reasoning of the agent. Note that it is correctly retreiving information from its knowledge base as it references the **Financial_Analyst_Agent** tool.

![wxo knowledge base test](images/wxo-knowledge-base-test.png) 

41- Continue testing your agent now by stressing the web search agent functionality. To do so, ask the following question.

Question: 
```
Who are top executives for Amazon?
```

Expand the **Show Reasoning**, **Step 1** and **Step 2** links (annotated with red arrows) to observe the agent's reasoning. Note that it transfers the request to **web_search_agent** and then to **get_tavily_search_results** tool as expected (annotated with red oval).
![wxo topexecs reasoning](images/wxo-topexecs-reasoning.png) 

42- Do some further testing by asking the agent the following question and then expanding the **Show Reasoning**, **Step 1**, and **Step 2** (annotated with red arrows) to observe the agent reasoning.
Question:
```
what does EBITDA mean?
```

Note that it transfers the request to **financial_api_agent** and then to **search_wikipedia** tool as annotated with red oval.

Feel free to explore and experience the power of Agents in action! 🚀 

## Conclusion
**Congratulations** on completing the hands-on lab portion of the bootcamp. 

To recap, you have used watsonx Orchestrate no-code functionality to develop a **Financial Analyst Agent** skilled at helping financial research analysts accelerate their research and due diligence in identifying new investment opportunities. You added knowledge to the agent by uploading knowledge documents in the form of pdf files capturing earning reports.

Next, you augrmented the **Financial Analyst Agent** capabilities by developing two other agents, the **Web Search Agent** and the **Financial API Agent** which are empowered with tools to execute web search queries and also retrieve information from finance APIs and glossary definition tools.
These tools and agents help increase the power of the **Financial Analyst Agent** in providing timely research results to the analysts.
